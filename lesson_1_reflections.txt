# 	Using diff I did not have to manually go through every line the processor being faster than me went through it and told me 
	the difference.

# 	Haivng easy access to the entire history of a file helps us know when and where the file was modified and if we 
	somehow loose the new file or do something which makes the file reduntant we will not loose our work totally 
	and we will be able to go back to the initial/orignal file.

#	The advantage of manual contorl over commits is that it is very flexible and disadvantage is that it is prone to user 
	error.
	The advantage of having versions automatically being saved is that user error's are prevented and disadvantage is that it 
	may not be the way we want it.

#	They show such behaviour because they are used and were built for different purposes.
#	The command "git log" tells us when all the  differences were made and "git diff" spots for us the 
	difference between two versions of the file.
