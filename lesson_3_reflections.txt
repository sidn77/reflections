Q. 	When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. 	When i want to collaborate or get views on my work till now from other people. Or in a circumstance when i can not depend 		on my computer's memory or i am working on my project from different machines.

Q. 	Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 		repository?
A.	Because i would want to be able to pick and choose the changes i want/don't want on my local repository.

Q.	Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A.	* Forks are basically clones on Github.
	* Clones are replicas of an existing repository on different machines or a locally on the same machhine.
	* Branches are different versions of the same project, basically the same project with a different head.
	* While cloning a repository on Github itself we use "forking.
	* While cloning a repository on a machine from a repository (locally or from Github) we use "clones".
	* While adding new features or playing around with a project we use "branches".
