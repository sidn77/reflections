#	When we initialize a repository it a hidden file .git is made and the file inside the directory we ran the command git init 
	becomes a repository.

#	Staging area is different from the working directory and respository in a way that it is a stage where before making a 			commit we can further recheck our changes.	

#	We can use the stage area to check that we have one commit per logical change as we haven't still made the commit when the 
	file is still in the stageing area so it basically exists so that we can double check our modifications.

# 	Git branches will help me use pre-existing code to make a new project or do modifications to a pre-existing one.

#	They give the exact cofigration of our workflow.

# 	By merging two branches we get our new and modified project. We represent it in a diagramtical manner to have a complete 		picture of our project.
